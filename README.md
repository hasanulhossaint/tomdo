> A minimalist, offline-ready, and privacy-focused Kanban board that runs entirely in your browser. No servers, no logins, no tracking—just your tasks.

TOMDO is a modern take on the classic Kanban board, built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed for individuals who need a fast, simple, and visually organized way to manage tasks without the overhead of complex software. All data is stored locally in your browser, ensuring your information remains private and accessible even when you're offline.
